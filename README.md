# MDA-Terraform-AWS-Resources
This is to demo EKS based Solution in AWS with Terraform, Go, React, Python, DevSecOps Tools
Authentincation -> Solution -> Pipeline -> DevSecOps -> Active/Active Set Up
# ðŸ”¹ Region 1 (Primary) Plan
1. Init Provider â€“ Define default AWS provider for Region 1 (provider "aws" { region = "us-east-1" }) & Region 2 for Aurora 
2. KMS Setup â€“ Create KMS managed key by portal - for S3, RDS, Secrets
3. Init Backend â€“ Configure remote state: S3 bucket + DynamoDB (encrypted using KMS) & Accounts Roles
4. # Apply and fix & ensure proper configuration
5. VPC Setup â€“ Public/private subnets, NAT, IGW 
 # Doing the Infra CIDR Plan #
6. Secrets Manager â€“ Store sensitive app configs (encrypted with KMS - do it by portal to not expose it in the statefile)

7. S3 Bucket â€“ Encrypted app storage
8. EKS Cluster â€“ Multi-node cluster + IAM roles
9. SES Setup â€“ Email sending config (region-specific)
10. Aurora PostgreSQL Primary â€“ Primary Aurora DB
11. Route 53 â€“ Global hosted zone setup
12. better by kustomize/helm : ArgoCD/CI/CD â€“ GitOps agents 
13. Github Action Terraform pipelines

App Deployment â€“ React frontend, Go backend

# ðŸ”¹ Region 2 (Secondary) Plan
Init Provider â€“ Define secondary region using alias (e.g., provider "aws" { alias = "eu" region = "eu-central-1" })

KMS Setup â€“ Create region-specific KMS keys

Init Backend â€“ Set up separate S3 + DynamoDB backend for this region

VPC Setup â€“ Networking in Region 2

Secrets Manager â€“ Replicate/create secrets with encryption

Aurora Read Replica â€“ Cross-region read replica

S3 Bucket with Replication â€“ Set replication from Region 1

EKS Cluster â€“ Same setup as Region 1

Route 53 Update â€“ Add latency/failover routing

ArgoCD/CI/CD â€“ Deploy GitOps agent in Region 2

Load Balancer/WAF â€“ Global access, region routing

App Deployment â€“ Same apps deployed
